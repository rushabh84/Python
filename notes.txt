Python:
writing data to
output file (data copied from ram to file)
reading data
read file
three step while using file
types of files and file access methods
filename extension (indicates type of data stored in file/)
file object (file object referenced by a variable)
open function
location of file
methods of file object: filevariable.close()
read method(): Only works if file has been opened for reading; Contents returned as a string
readline: Line returned as a string, including '\n'
read position: location of next item to be read
concatenating /n and stripping it: rsrtip method
append data
readline method uses empty string as sentinel
for loop to read file: reads each liine of file  (syntax) = iterate once over each line
record and field
exception
traceback: error message, line numebr and type and brief description
many exception prevented by carefu coding (input validatin) and other not (opena fie to read that doesnt exist, convert non-numeric string to an integer)
exception handler
try suite
handler
if no exception are raised then handler are skipped
statements in try suite may raise multiple exceptions, exception with exceptionname must be written at last
exception object: created when error is thrown, contains default error message. syntax, pass exception object to print the message
else clause: optional, aligned with try except, syntax similar to else in decision making
finally: after all except clause, ceanup before exiting
2 ways for exception to go unhandled: except clause with inappropriate exceptionname and statement outside try suite




Recursion:
A function that calls itself. must have a way to contorl number of times it is called itself. usually involves if else statement which defines when function should return value and when should it call itself
depth of recursion:
base case
recursive case
Usually the problem is reduced by making one or more parameters smaller at each function call
direct recursion and indirect recursion
sumrange(numlist, start, end)
fibonacci: if n==0 or 1, returns 0 or 1 otherwise fib(n-2)+fib(n-1)  [has 2 base cases]


Function:
function executed in order-divide and conquer approach
modularized program: each task has its own function
benefits of modularizing program:
void and value returning fucntion(input, int and float are examples)
function name is often verb
function definition describes what function does
function header: def , funciton name and ():
block: group of statements that belong together
Interpreter jumps back to part of program that called the function Known as function return
main function: called when program starts, defines mainline logic of the program
block indentation
blnak lines in block are ignored
top-down design: technique to break algorithm in function, each funtion has its own flowchart, end terminal means return
hierarchical chart=structure chart: defines relationship between functions
Use input function to have program wait for user to press enter
local variable and its scope (part of program where variable can be accessesd)
Different functions may have local variables with the same name 
arguements
parameter variable: a variable thats is assigned the value of an arguement, and they both refernce the same variable
scope of parametere: function in which it is used
passing multiple arguements: paramter list used instead of parameter
Arguments are passed by position to corresponding parameters
PASS BY VALUE: Changes made to a parameter value within the function do not affect the argument.Provides a way for unidirectional communication between one function and another function
keyword arguement: arguement that sepcifies parameter to which the value should be assigned to. position is irrelevant
Possible to mix keyword and positional arguments when calling a function. Positional arguments must appear first 
If a function needs to assign a value to the global variable, the global variable must be redeclared within the function
why avoid global variable
global constant: global name that references value that cannot be changed.To simulate global constant in Python, create global variable and do not re-declare it within functions
Standard library functions: library with built in predefined functions that comes with python., viewed as blackbox.
Module: files that has functions of standard library. import statement at top of program
dot notation: module name.
randrange function: similar to range function, returns a random number from sequence generated. same arguements as range function (returns integer)
random function: returns random float between 0.0 and 1.0 (returns float)
uniform function: returns random float but use can provide rane
seed value: initializes formula to generate random number
random number seeds: uses system time to produce seeds, random.seed() to sepcify seed
syntax: return expression
IPO Chart: tool to design and document function (3 different columns, used intsead of flowchart)
return multiple values, on the left side of = operator need seperate variables to hold values

MOdularization:  related funcions are grouped together
module name ends with .py
menu-drivern programs
